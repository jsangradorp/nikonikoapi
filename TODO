- Persist model values (check with device rotation)
- Add an 'application-token' parameter to the login endpoint, and allow for
  application-requested tokens which expire differently.
- Review running directions in README.md, I tried them in a clean system and I
  failed to run the API (not for the docker-compose, although some friction
  there too)
- Add missing endpoint in openspec.yaml
- Make a better email template for password reset code
- Create beautiful README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, etc.
- Make it multi tenant
- Review and account for wrong input and other corner cases. Proper error management
- Review security
- Investigate and fix why DB SSL breaks when multithreading
  - First, replicate the bug
  - Then, create test that shows it
  - Finally, fix it
