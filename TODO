- Fix DB bootstrapping (looks like serials are getting in the way)
- Review running directions in README.md, I tried them in a clean system and I
  failed to run the API (not for the docker-compose, although some friction
  there too)
- Add missing endpoint in openspec.yaml
- Make a better email template for password reset code
- Create beautiful README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, etc.
- Make it multi tenant
- Review and account for wrong input and other corner cases. Proper error management
- Review security
- Investigate and fix why DB SSL breaks when multithreading
